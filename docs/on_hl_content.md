Please note that according to the Half-Life SDK license, you are not
allowed to use any Half-Life content in any non-Valve engine. This means
that you cannot release any games made on Pathos that include Half-Life
content. This means sounds, models, textures, sounds, etc.

Pathos was for this reason not designed to be a drop-in replacement for
Half-Life, but it's also not that difficult to move content over. With
this in mind, please consider any content borrowed from HL as being just
placeholder material.

This isn't my decision, it's Valve's decision. My aim with releasing
Pathos is to help those who want something similar to Half-Life, but
newer, better, faster, more versatile. Hopefully, that's enough to
help you build on.
